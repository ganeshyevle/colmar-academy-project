#  Colmar Academy Project

## About The Project

This project was completed as part of `Codecademy's Build a Website with HTML, CSS, and Github Pages Path`. This was the learn how to build websites capstone project, in which I applied everything I had learned to build a responsive site from scratch. I am tasked with designing and creating the landing page for a new school.

For this project you will implement the site specified by the wireframes and make all remaining design decisions to complete the site. You can find the wireframes for this project [here](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/capstone-2/colmar-academy-spec.png).
